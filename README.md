# StretchyJoint
A few thoughts on the script:

My aim behavior approach:
I am aware that I just could have created an aim constraint or an IK system, but for me this part was kind of a proof of concept,  because I was recently following the stream recordings of "Cult of Rig" and it was a good learning opportuinity for me. I also heard constraints can be pretty expensive on the performance side, but currently I am not sure if an aim constraint is one of those heavy constraints or if my setup is more performant than a constraint would be. This is just to explain why I decided to make it a bit more complicated on this part.

Script structure:
I feel like I should have branched out the build-method into more smaller methods to make it more readible and would upload another version of the script, that has smaller additional methods that take care of each of the different behaviors, if requested.
  
Info:
For the script to run it's necessary that the matrix plugin (that ships with Maya) is loaded.
